Subject: [PATCH] Enhance pg_restore to track successful and failed object restoration

Hi hackers,

I would like to propose an enhancement to pg_restore that adds comprehensive
object status tracking during database restoration. This feature addresses
a common pain point for database administrators who need to understand
which objects failed during restoration and why.

## Problem

Currently, when pg_restore encounters errors during restoration, it's
difficult to get a clear picture of:
- Which specific objects succeeded vs failed
- Why objects failed (beyond scrolling through potentially long logs)
- Which failures are due to dependency cascades vs actual errors
- Which objects might be retryable after fixing underlying issues

## Solution

This patch adds object status tracking that provides:

1. **Detailed restoration status**: Track success/failure for each object,
   separating schema and data restoration phases

2. **Error message capture**: Store specific error messages for failed
   objects for easier debugging

3. **Dependency analysis**: Show which objects failed due to dependency
   failures, helping identify root causes

4. **Comprehensive summary**: Display a clear summary at the end showing:
   - Count of successful/failed objects
   - List of failed objects with error messages
   - Dependency relationships between failed objects

## Example Output

```
Restoration Summary:
===================
Successfully restored objects: 145
Failed objects: 3

Failed Objects (including dependency failures):
  TABLE "public.users": Schema creation failed
  INDEX "public.idx_users_email": Schema creation failed
  CONSTRAINT "public.fk_user_profile": Schema creation failed

Objects that might need retry due to dependencies:
  INDEX "public.idx_users_email" depends on failed TABLE "public.users"
  CONSTRAINT "public.fk_user_profile" depends on failed TABLE "public.users"
```

## Implementation Details

- Minimal memory overhead using dynamic arrays that grow as needed
- Compatible with both single-threaded and parallel restoration modes
- Proper memory management with cleanup functions
- Integrates cleanly with existing error handling mechanisms

The tracking adds fields to TocEntry and ArchiveHandle structures to store
restoration status and maintains arrays of successful/failed objects for
summary reporting.

## Testing

The patch builds cleanly and the implementation follows PostgreSQL coding
conventions. The enhancement is backward compatible and doesn't change
existing pg_restore behavior beyond adding the summary output.

Thoughts and feedback welcome!
