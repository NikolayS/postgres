# PostgreSQL pg_restore Enhancement: Object Status Tracking

## Overview

This branch contains an enhancement to `pg_restore` that adds comprehensive object status tracking during database restoration. The enhancement provides detailed information about which database objects were successfully restored and which failed, including dependency analysis.

## Features

### ✅ What's Implemented

1. **Detailed Object Tracking**
   - Tracks success/failure status for each database object
   - Separates schema and data restoration phases
   - Records specific error messages for failed objects

2. **Comprehensive Summary Report**
   - Shows count of successful vs failed objects
   - Lists all failed objects with error messages
   - Analyzes dependency relationships between failed objects
   - Identifies objects that might be retryable after fixing dependencies

3. **File Output for Analysis and Automation**
   - Generates `successful_objects.txt` with list of successful restorations
   - Creates `successful_objects.list` in pg_restore -l compatible format
   - Produces `failed_objects.txt` with detailed failure information
   - Generates `retry_objects.sql` script for retrying failed objects

4. **Memory Efficient Implementation**
   - Uses dynamic arrays that grow as needed
   - Proper memory management with cleanup functions
   - Minimal overhead during restoration

5. **Parallel Restore Compatible**
   - Works with both single-threaded and parallel restoration modes
   - Thread-safe tracking implementation

6. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Full PostgreSQL regression test suite
   - Tests success scenarios, failure scenarios, and edge cases
   - Validates backward compatibility

## Enhanced Output Example

```
Restoration Summary:
===================
Successfully restored objects: 145
Failed objects: 3

Failed Objects (including dependency failures):
  TABLE "public.users": Schema creation failed
  INDEX "public.idx_users_email": Schema creation failed
  CONSTRAINT "public.fk_user_profile": Schema creation failed

Objects that might need retry due to dependencies:
  INDEX "public.idx_users_email" depends on failed TABLE "public.users"
  CONSTRAINT "public.fk_user_profile" depends on failed TABLE "public.users"

INFO:  Successful objects list written to: successful_objects.txt
INFO:  Failed objects list written to: failed_objects.txt
INFO:  Retry script written to: retry_objects.sql
```

   CONSTRAINT "public.fk_user_profile": Schema creation failed
   ```

4. **`retry_objects.sql`**
   ```sql
   -- pg_restore retry script for failed objects
   -- Generated: 2024-05-23 18:45:12 UTC
   -- Total failed objects: 3
   -- NOTE: Review and modify this script before execution

   -- Retry: TABLE "public.users"
   -- Previous error: Schema creation failed
   CREATE TABLE public.users (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`src/bin/pg_dump/pg_backup_archiver.h`**
   - Enhanced `TocEntry` structure with restoration status fields
   - Enhanced `ArchiveHandle` structure with tracking arrays
   - Added function declarations for object tracking

2. **`src/bin/pg_dump/pg_backup_archiver.c`**
   - Implemented 6 new object tracking functions
   - Integrated tracking calls into restoration workflow
   - Added summary reporting and cleanup

3. **`src/bin/pg_dump/t/007_pg_restore_object_tracking.pl`**
   - Comprehensive regression test suite
   - Tests success and failure scenarios
   - Validates file generation and backward compatibility

### Key Functions Added

- `init_object_tracking()` - Initialize tracking arrays
- `record_object_success()` - Record successful restoration
- `record_object_failure()` - Record failed restoration with error message
- `print_restoration_summary()` - Display comprehensive summary
- `write_object_lists_to_files()` - Generate output files
- `cleanup_object_tracking()` - Clean up allocated memory

### Integration Points

- Tracking initialization in `RestoreArchive()`
- Success/failure recording after each `_printTocEntry()` call
- Summary printing and cleanup at restoration completion

## Building and Testing

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL source code (18beta1 or later)
- Standard build tools (gcc, make, etc.)
- Perl with PostgreSQL::Test modules for regression tests

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Configure PostgreSQL
./configure --enable-debug --without-icu

# Compile
make -j$(nproc)

# Install to temporary directory
make install DESTDIR=/tmp/postgres_install prefix=

# Test the enhanced pg_restore
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/tmp/postgres_install/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
/tmp/postgres_install/bin/pg_restore --help
```

### Running Regression Tests

```bash
# Run the specific object tracking test
prove src/bin/pg_dump/t/007_pg_restore_object_tracking.pl

# Run all pg_dump tests
make check -C src/bin/pg_dump

# Run full test suite
make check-world
```

### Testing the Enhancement

To see the enhancement in action:

1. Create a PostgreSQL database with test data
2. Use `pg_dump` to create a backup
3. Restore using the enhanced `pg_restore`
4. Observe the detailed summary output at the end

Example workflow:
```bash
# Set up environment
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/tmp/postgres_install/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"

# Dump a database
/tmp/postgres_install/bin/pg_dump -d testdb -f testdb.dump

# Restore with enhanced tracking
/tmp/postgres_install/bin/pg_restore -d targetdb testdb.dump
# (Enhanced summary will be displayed at the end)
```

## Benefits for Database Administrators

1. **Faster Problem Diagnosis**
   - Immediately see which objects failed and why
   - No need to scroll through long log files

2. **Better Understanding of Failures**
   - Clear visibility into dependency relationships
   - Identify root causes of cascading failures

3. **Improved Restoration Workflows**
   - Know exactly which objects need attention
   - Understand which objects might succeed after fixing dependencies

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Better integration with automation and monitoring systems
   - Clear success/failure metrics

5. **Automation Support**
   - Generated files can be used in scripts
   - Retry scripts help automate recovery processes

- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Testing Coverage

The regression test suite covers:
